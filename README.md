# uncomfortable-coffeemaker

Unnecessarily complicated firmware for ESP32 to run my office coffee maker because we stuck a knife in it and it broke. Please do not use it.

## Features

- Human-unfriendly
- Self destruction
- AP mode: use the coffeemaker as absolutely not reliable router for your office network
- Voice & intent recognition
- Says bullshit about coffee
- Remote control (only, no buttons or other std human controls)
- FTP
- It reminds you that you could die at any moment of your life
- Self hosted website for coffee statistics
- Badass
